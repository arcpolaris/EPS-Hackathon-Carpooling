        <h1>About</h1>
        <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>This is a website that was created by Denali Srivastava(27’) and Zoe Stone(28’).</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Who?</h3>
    <p>In Denali’s free time, she loves to do archery and program/design robots for the EPS robotics team(JV). When asked about Denali, many responded with a list of (terrible) dad jokes that Denali had made to them. Though Denali’s music taste is questionable, there has never been any question that she is a great programmer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In Zoe’s free time, she plays basketball for EPS and works with The Museum of Flight in a program that brings young women into careers in aviation and aerospace. When asked about Zoe, many stated that they had never heard her form a cohesive sentence. Though she is only a beginner programmer, many have stated that she has begun a path toward a future in programming.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Denali and Zoe created this site during a hackathon hosted by EPS. They made this site as a way to make EPS and the greater Seattle area more sustainable. Zoe and Denali’s site was made to reduce carbon emissions by encouraging students to carpool. </p>
  <br> 
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>Denali and Zoe used Replit as their IDE. Other sources they used are: https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/font/ (To find a good font for CSS), https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php (To give Zoe a jumping-off point), They also used Abode Illustrator(To make a logo),https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp (To teach Zoe Iframes), https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56418763/creating-the-perfect-rainbow-gradient-in-css(To make the gradient on the button),
